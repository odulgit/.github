### Abstract
OdulGit is actually an on-chain dev-centric tool designed for developers. There’re 3 key elements of it.
First, bounty as the incentive for developer community. Anyone on GitHub could list the issue with reward.  
Second, as every issues is awarded, the real contributors could be engaged more precisely by the project owner. (of course, in that way, we believe the sybil attack could be mitigated.
Third, the pull request is verified and voted  by DAO, a group of code owners, to facilitate the pull request reviewing process and make it more objective
